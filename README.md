# Bookshelf - a React playground app

After finishing the brilliant [Wes Bos React course](https://reactforbeginners.com/), I just try to do a from-scratch React app using the latest version of Google Firebase 3.x

## Install

```
$ npm install
```

You have to create also an `app/config.json` who should look like :

```
{
  "firebase": {
    "apiKey": "...",
    "authDomain": "...",
    "databaseURL": "...",
    "storageBucket": "..."
  }
}

```

## Code 

```
$ gulp serve
```

... and open into your favorite IDE :wink:
